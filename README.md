# Vulnerability-Assessment-Lab

## Objective

- The Vulnerability-Assessment-Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating environment for detecting and remediating vulnerabilities bringing them to an acceptable level.This hands on experience enhanced my understanding of vulnerability assessments that take place in real world.
- So basically in this project I installed a vulnerability scanner on a machine and then scanned an another machine with it also made it vulnearable simulating real world environment.


### Skills Learned 

- Advanced understanding of Virtual Machines, Hypervisors and their Network Adapter Configurations.
- Nessus Essesntials
- Some understanding of Firewall settings and a few ports. 
- Ability to remediate vulnerabilities.

  

### Tools Used
- A hypervisor with a Windows ISO or Kali Linux ISO(Windows preferred).
- Vulnerability Scanner(Nessus).



## Steps
- To begin with on Host machine I installed a Hypervisor(VmWare) and downloaded Windows 10 Iso and installed it as well.
- Configured the Windows 10 machine so as both the Host machine and the Win10 machine could communicate with each other by keeping the Network Adapter on Bridged mode.
- Then Installed Nessus software on the Host machine and configured so as it could scan Windows 10 machine successfully.
- Deliberately uninstalled latest Windows updates on the Virtual Machine and paused all the automatic Windows updates on it trying to make the machine vulnearable.
- Turned the Firewall off as it prevented Nessus from successfull scanning and gave some errors.
- Performed the First Credential Scan with outdated Windows updates and got a few vulnerabilities which are visible in the Images that are linked at the end. 
- Analyzed the scanned result that I got throught the CVE's and moved on as I planned something more than that.
- Then installed outdated version of Chrome full of vulnerabilities in Windows 10 Vm.
- Performed some more scan and got a few more vulnerabilities analysed then thoroughly to see the solutions provided by Nessus.
- Then finally updated Windows and Chrome to latest version.
- Then did the final Scan and made sure all the vulnerabilities were remediated.
